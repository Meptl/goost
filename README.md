Goost is a [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) extension
implemented as a
[C++ module](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html).
The extension consists of functional components and other modules, most of which
should be optional to build.

See [Goost official documentation](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/) for
detailed instructions on how to use the extension and the list of currently
implemented components. For a complete list of currently implemented classes,
refer to [Goost API](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/classes/index.html).

We strongly recommend to familiarize yourself with our
[development philosophy](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/general_principles.html).

## üîΩ Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot + Goost editor and the export templates can be
found on the [Download](https://goostengine.github.io/download.html) page.

### Goals üéØ
- ***Complement*** the engine by implementing missing or not-yet-implemented
  functionality as seen useful by the Godot community, helping to prevent
  further engine bloat to a reasonable extent;
- Provide additional core data structures, classes and methods to optimize
  performance-critical tasks in a general-purpose way for when GDScript or other
  languages are too slow, or when better integration is desired with existing
  libraries;
- Expose, reuse, and build upon the engine's hidden built-in functionality
  typically unavailable to scripting;
- Overcome engine limitations which may be difficult to do via script,
  especially when those limitations can be mitigated on the module level without
  having to maintain a custom version of the engine.

### Non-goals üåí
- Solving project-specific problems. Consider alternative projects such as
  [Godot Node Extensions](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-next)
  instead.
- Collecting arbitrary community C++ modules for the sake of it. Goost provides
  a separate project for this purpose in the
  [goostengine/godot-modules](https://github.com/goostengine/godot-modules)
  repository, which also includes this extension as a `git` submodule.

### Community channels üé≠

Join [#goost](https://discord.gg/w6jBZnG) Discord channel at the
[GEL](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries) Discord server for discussion
and development updates.

## Building üèó

For testing and debugging purposes, build artifacts are uploaded for Linux,
macOS, and Windows builds which can be downloaded manually for each recently
built commit:

- [üêß `Linux`: Editor](https://nightly.link/goostengine/goost/workflows/linux_builds/gd3/godot.x11.opt.tools.64.goost.zip)
- [üêß `Linux`: Server Headless + Sanitizers](https://nightly.link/goostengine/goost/workflows/linux_builds/gd3/godot_server.x11.tools.64.goosts.zip)
- [üçé `macOS`: Editor](https://nightly.link/goostengine/goost/workflows/macos_builds/gd3/godot.osx.opt.tools.64.goost.zip)
- [üé® `Windows`: Editor](https://nightly.link/goostengine/goost/workflows/windows_builds/gd3/godot.windows.opt.tools.64.goost.zip)

If the links provided by [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/) above don't work,
proceed to [GitHub Actions tab](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/actions) (have to be logged in).

### Compiling

```sh
git clone https://github.com/goostengine/goost --recurse-submodules
cd goost
python goost.py config # Optional, pick components to build.
scons
```

This will clone the Godot Engine repository and compile the engine with Goost.
You'll find the resulting binaries at `godot/bin` directory relative to the
Goost repository.

For more advanced compilation options, refer to
[Goost Installation](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/usage/installation.html)
documentation pages.

## Development üß±

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in development and to
find out what kind of features are accepted.

### Writing and running tests

While not mandatory, developers are encouraged to write unit tests (or any tests
for that matter) for any existing or new features. See [tests](tests/README.md)
for details.

After build, run tests with the following command:

```
python run.py tests
```

### Writing and generating documentation

The documentation can be generated for new classes, and updated for existing
ones. See the following official documentation pages for further instructions:

- [Contribute to the Class Reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/updating_the_class_reference.html)
- [Writing custom documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html#writing-custom-documentation)

To easily generate new or update existing documentation, run:

```
python run.py doc
```

The `editor` command is also useful for manually checking and proof-reading the
built-in documentation from within the editor, especially when you want to make
sure that all references work as expected:

```
python run.py editor
```

### Versioning and compatibility

There are separate branches which are targeted for specific Godot Engine's major
version.

Regarding latest extension development version, switch to
* [`gd3`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/tree/gd3) branch for Godot 3.x
* [`gd4`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/tree/gd4) branch for Godot 4.x (does not exist yet).

Similarly, you may use any of the stable branches with a similar branch
encoding, such as `1.0-gd3` or `1.0-gd4`, if available.

Any new features are encouraged to be developed against the latest Godot
Engine's *stable* version, which may be optionally ported to the latest engine's
*development* version (independently or in sync, depending on priorities).

## License üìù

Unless otherwise specified, the extension is released under the
[MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

See the full list of third-party libraries with their licenses used by this
extension at [thirdparty/README.md](thirdparty/README.md).
